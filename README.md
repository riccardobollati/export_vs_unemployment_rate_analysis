# export_vs_unemployment_rate_analysis
This is a project I've done for an internship assesment, the goal was to find the correlation between the unemployment rate of a country and It's export.
The dataset I had to use misses a lot of data so I've tried to handle these data to achive the goal of analyzing the correlation.
The script contains some interactive widgets, you coul'd have some problem tryng running them in VS code.

the main file contains the workflow and invoke all the accesories function I've created that are contained in the files:
- manage_data.py: this module contains all the function I've created to download the data from the database and turn the raw data into a dataframe
- plot_data.py: this module contain the function I've created to plot the interactive chart

The repository also includes the documentation of the file where all the technical details of the code are explained.
